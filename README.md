I'm a passionate and adaptable *Full Stack Junior Developer* with a keen interest in web development. Since graduating university I have been working in HR for a start up company, helping evolve and shape employees futures. Automation has always been something I am passionate about, and in January 2019 I decided to work towards making that passion my purpose. Currently, I am a student at Makers Academy, due to graduate in May 2019. I am looking for opportunities to express my creative nature and fascination for web development, in a company which will both nurture my continuous education, and challenge me to create outstanding programmes.

## Skills

#### Logical Thinker

One of my strengths is the ability to think logically yet intuitively about processes and functions. This is a skill that I have honed throughout my career in HR in various contexts from policy writing to software development. For example, during my time as a HR Assistant, I collaborated in the creation of a new portal for tracking holiday and absences. This involved working with the in house development team to create a beautifully designed system that was not only user friendly for employees, but suited to the job.

#### Adaptive Worker

I've achieved new heights of work environment adaptability during both my degree and HR employment. While I have always been a people person, HR enabled me to fine tune my team working abilities for a variety of tasks ranging from employee wellbeing events to launching new policies. Collaboration with others comes naturally to me, however I am also a very proactive and meticulous individual who is able to accomplish masses on her own; An example of this is my BSc in Psychology which involved a large proportion of self directed study.  

#### Quick Learner 

Learning new technologies is a key skill of mine, which can be demonstrated through my success at Makers Academy thus far. Due to my inquisitive nature and my speedy knowledge on-boarding, I was able to create a mock web page in my spare time using self taught basics of javascript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap for my personal web development interest prior to joining Makers.

#### Creative Innovator

Whist at university, I founded and chaired a volunteering society focused on walking and helping re home rescue dogs. Although it was an incredibly rewarding experience, pursuing this society gave me a plethora of experience in creating new ideas, bringing them to life and formulating a working model. The society still runs on today and has received plenty of awards for its work.


## Projects

| Project       | Summary       | Technologies  | Testing |
| ------------- |---------------| --------------|---------|
| 1. Makers BnB in Ruby and Javascript ([Repo](https://github.com/LaurenQurashi/MakersBnB)) |This project was set during my time at Makers Academy. The task was to replicate AirBnb, but our team decided to throw in our own twist. The main point of the task was to practice an Agile workflow and team collaboration, which our team excelled at. During this project, I also ambitious to practice both my Javascript and Ruby abilities, so I decided to learn a lot about APIs, and chose to make one from scratch. |Ruby, Javascript | RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara |
| 2. Bookmarks ([Repo](https://github.com/LaurenQurashi/Bookmarks)) | This project involed using databases to make a bookmark manager. This project was my first experience with using databases, and we negotiated this feature using TablePlus and postgreSQL. This project also taught me wonders about using imported CSS libraries such as bootstrap, rather than self made style sheets. | Ruby, SQL, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap |RSpec, Capybara |
