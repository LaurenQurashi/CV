I'm a passionate and adaptable Full Stack Junior Developer with a keen interest in web development. Since graduating university I have been working in HR for a start up company, helping evolve and shape employees futures. Automation has always been something I am passionate about, and in January 2019 I decided to work towards making that passion my purpose. Currently, I am a student at Makers Academy, due to graduate in May 2019. I am looking for opportunities to express my creative nature and fascination for web development, in a company which will both nurture my continuous education, and challenge me to create outstanding programmes.

## Skills

#### Logical Thinker

One of my strengths is the ability to think logically yet intuitively about processes and functions. This is a skill that I have honed throughout my career in HR in various contexts from policy writing to software development. For example, during my time as a HR Assistant, I collaborated in the creation of a new portal for tracking holiday and absences. This involved working with the in house development team to create a beautifully designed system that was not only user friendly for employees, but suited to the job.

#### Adaptive Worker

I've achieved new heights of work environment adaptability during both my degree and HR employment. While I have always been a people person, HR enabled me to fine tune my team working abilities for a variety of tasks ranging from employee wellbeing events to launching new policies. Collaboration with others comes naturally to me, however I am also a very proactive and meticulous individual who is able to accomplish masses on her own; An example of this is my BSc in Psychology which involved a large proportion of self directed study.  

#### Quick Learner 

Learning new technologies is a key skill of mine, which can be demonstrated through my success at Makers Academy thus far. Due to my inquisitive nature and my speedy knowledge on-boarding, I was able to create a mock web page in my spare time using self taught basics of javascript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap for my personal web development interest prior to joining Makers.

#### Creative Innovator

Whist at university, I founded and chaired a volunteering society focused on walking and helping re home rescue dogs. Although it was an incredibly rewarding experience, pursuing this society gave me a plethora of experience in creating new ideas, bringing them to life and formulating a working model. The society still runs on today and has received plenty of awards for its work.
